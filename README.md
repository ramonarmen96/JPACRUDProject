Pokemon TCG Database

### Description
This Application is designed for the user to be able to Create,
Update, and Delete Objects within the database. The database
contains different Pokemon Cards from the First set released in
1996. Because it allows the user to create Pokemon Cards the
user can add cards that are not in the original set. The
first cards I added were in the order of the Pokemon cards, but
if the user decides to add cards they do not have to follow that
order. The user can scroll right to the card they want to edit or
delete and the tool bar is right next to it. I would consider
some of these to be bugs, but I can see how it would be useful if
you wanted to build another database with another card set. It
would make it really easy to edit without having to search for
the card.

### Technologies and Topics Covered:

* Entity Manager
* Java Persistence API(Application Programming Interface)
* JDBC(Java Database Connectivity)
* SQL
* MySQLWorkbench
* BootStrap
* HTML
* Java

### Lessons Learned
I touched on some of the bugs I realized the program contained, and
I am not completely sure how I would change it to prevent a user
from adding cards out of order or cards that do not belong in this
card set. I could possibly add other card sets and make some kind of
filter to the name, but it may defeat the purpose of making it a CRUD
Project. This project was extremely satisfying after completing each
step.
